### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Karan Patil a Programmer with interest in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Software Development. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Resource Management System for Restaurants. This will help a restaurant and a cloud kitchen business to optimize the resource usage
  and will help to gain increased productivity. This is an ML project which will cater the users with a robust user interface as well as an analytics dashboard
  which will give real-time data analysis for the users. Technologies such as Flask, Django and FastAPI are helping me build a strong backend for the APIs and VueJS is giving me the opportunity to deliver great user interface.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning Techniques and Business Analytics. I have gained insights into Supervised and Unsupervise machine 
  learning algorithms and used algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees for prediction of the classified customer for a restaurant chain
   the clustering algorithms gave me insights about the data which later used by the supervised ML model to predict the data. KNN and DBSCAN are the two algorithms which
  helped me cluster the RFM analysis data into different customer segments.
